    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For Aioli: Combine garlic cloves, olive oil, and the 1/2 teaspoon soul
        seasoning in a small bowl and toss to coat. Wrap garlic tightly in a
        small piece of foil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place wrapped
        garlic in the air fryer basket, and air fry for 15 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove garlic from the air fryer and place in a small bowl. Mash roasted
        garlic with the back of a spoon. Let stand for 30 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir mayonnaise and lemon juice into the mashed garlic until well
        combined. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
      </li>

      <li>
        For Cheese Curds: Place cheese curds on a large rimmed baking sheet
        lined with parchment paper. Place the tray with cheese curds in the
        freezer for 30 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, whisk flour and 1 teaspoon soul seasoning together in a
        shallow bowl. Whisk eggs and milk together In a separate bowl until
        smooth and cohesive. Stir panko and remaining 3 teaspoons soul seasoning
        together in a third shallow bowl.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove cheese curds from the freezer. Working in batches, dip cheese
        curds into the flour to coat well, then into the egg mixture, making
        sure to shake off any excess. Dip curds again in flour mixture and again
        into egg mixture. Finally, dip curds into panko to fully coat with
        breadcrumbs. Use your dry hand to pack on panko so that it sticks well.
        Place breaded cheese curds back onto the baking sheet. When all cheese
        curds are breaded, return the baking sheet to the freezer for 30
        minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove tray from
        freezer. Using a mister, lightly spray both sides of the cheese curds
        with vegetable oil. Coat the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking
        spray.
      </li>

      <li>
        Working in batches, place cheese curds in the air fryer basket in a
        single layer. Air fry until golden brown and crispy on both sides,
        flipping halfway through cooking time, 4 to 6 minutes.
