    <h1>Omlette</h1>
    <img src="../images/omlette.jpg">
    <p>Not only is an omelette quick and easy to make, it is a paragon of economy. Odds and ends (a.k.a. leftovers) rise to a new level when placed inside an omelette.</p>
    <p>Leftover, cooked vegetables paired with a little cheese and folded into eggs present a much more cheerful meal than a bowl of vegetables haphazardly reheated in the microwave!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs </li>
        <li>Pinch salt </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated cheese</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half and sprinkled lightly with salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped basil, parsley, or herb of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the eggs: </strong>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a small pinch of salt and beat the eggs with a fork until they are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the butter: </strong> In an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter. </li>
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and cook the omelette: </strong> 
            <p>Add the eggs to the skillet and cook without stirring until the edges begin to set. With a silicone spatula, push the edges toward the center of the pan and tilt the pan so the uncooked eggs move to the edge. </p>
            <p>Repeat until the eggs are somewhat set but still a little soft in the center, about 6 minutes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
