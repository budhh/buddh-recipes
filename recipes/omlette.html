    <h1>Omlette</h1>
    <img src="../images/omlette.jpg">
    <p> Not only is an omelette quick and easy to make, it is a paragon of economy. Odds and ends (a.k.a. leftovers) rise to a new level when placed inside an omelette.</p>
    <p>Leftover, cooked vegetables paired with a little cheese and folded into eggs present a much more cheerful meal than a bowl of vegetables haphazardly reheated in the microwave!</p>
